## Sem 1 - Learning basic ARM Coding
The message below on the course website
 " Codemark uses GNU ARM Assembly, ARMv5TE Architecture and runs programs on a simulated Gumstix Connex (PXA255).
Code written in other assembly languages (e.g. Keil), for other ARM architectures or for other boards will not work. "

I typed the codes on notepad and tested them directly on the course website provided by Prof John Waldron.
TCD Students can use https://www.scss.tcd.ie/John.Waldron/CSU33D01/CSU33D01.html? for other materials as well. 
You will need to be a registered TCD student to be able to submit code.

Since I did not upload the original files but rather each code is extracted from the "Show Results" section of the website you will need to remove the line numbering in each before you run it. 

## Sem 2 - Learning to code a Raspberry Pi PICO in C and ARM
I learned how to code the Raspberry Pi in C and ARM. This repository originally existed on Gitlab for TCD. I moved it out here because everything is here.

### Labs
The "Labs" folder contains all the codes that I had to submit on a weekly basis. The more important codes are in the Assignment folders.

### Assignment 1 
This is one of the major step ups in the code. I wrote about 200 lines of arm I think. It uses an Alarm Interrupt to blink an LED. It catches button using GPIO interrupts to increase/decrease speed of the blinking of the onboard LED or to simply pause and resume blinking. It also displays appropriate message using c wrapper classes, you can view it using a PuTTy console. 

### Assignment 2 
Coming soon...
