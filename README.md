Hello there!

The message below on the course website
 " Codemark uses GNU ARM Assembly, ARMv5TE Architecture and runs programs on a simulated Gumstix Connex (PXA255).
Code written in other assembly languages (e.g. Keil), for other ARM architectures or for other boards will not work. "

I typed the codes on notepad and tested them directly on the course website provided by Prof John Waldron.
TCD Students can use https://www.scss.tcd.ie/John.Waldron/CSU33D01/CSU33D01.html? for other materials as well. 
You will need to be a registered TCD student to be able to submit code.

Since I did not upload the original files but rather each code is extracted from the "Show Results" section of the website you will need to remove the line numbering in each before you run it.
