
Results from Sequential Run

Time for taken for float calculations: 381646 microseconds
Time taken for double calculations: 760042 microseconds
Total Time: 1141789 microseconds

Results from Parallel Run			

Time for taken for float calculations: 399115 microseconds
Time taken for double calculations: 776618 microseconds
Total Time: 776623 microseconds

-------------------------------------------------------------

Observations:

For the sequential run
Total Time = Time for Float + Time for Double (approximately)
The minimal difference is due to the time required in moving between instructions

For the parallel run
Total Time = max{Time for Float, Time for Double} (approximately)
The total time was equal to the time for whichever function ran for longer
I switched the cores in which either function was running to find this result
